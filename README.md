# Connect four

How to run:

build using maven, and then run:

java -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -jar connect-four-web/target/connect-four-web-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.config.location=config/connect-four.properties

where config/connect-four.properties is path to your own configuration file. (This project has default configuration, so it is not required to include the properties file)
